      Those killer eyes of yours… they don’t just look at me, they see right through me. There’s something about the way they hold emotion — playful one second, deep and mysterious the next — that makes it impossible to look away. Sometimes they’re soft, almost shy, and other times they carry this bold confidence that completely takes over my thoughts. I swear, one glance from you can change my mood instantly. It’s not just about how beautiful they are — it’s the feeling behind them. The warmth, the mischief, the intensity. When you look at me, it feels personal, like the world fades for a second and it’s just us in that moment. And honestly? If loving someone could start with just a pair of eyes, yours would be more than enough.
