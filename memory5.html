    I love you, my love, my dudu, my rani, meri sab kuch, mela bachaaaaa. I don’t think I say it enough, but you truly mean everything to me. If I’ve ever annoyed you, hurt you, or made you feel even a little misunderstood, I’m genuinely sorry. Sometimes I’ve been quiet when I should’ve spoken louder, sometimes I’ve been a coward when I should’ve stood stronger — but no more. I promise you, I’m growing. I’ll be the one who raises his voice for you when it matters, the one who stands in front when things get tough, the one who protects what’s precious to him. And you are the most precious thing in my life.

You know I joke around saying dusro ko muh todna, but what I really mean is I’ll always defend you, always support you, always make sure you feel safe with me. And haan, mere liye thoda cute cute karte rehna… send me those random photos, those unexpected VNs, sometimes a VC out of nowhere — I love it all. I love seeing you, hearing you, feeling that little connection even when we’re apart. Even your smallest efforts make my entire day better.

I promise I will protect you, love you deeply, and never leave your side. That’s not just words — that’s something I carry in my heart. Hehe… and tell me, do you remember that hair? The way it fell on your face that day? I swear I still think about it. I still smile about it. Because every little detail about you stays with me.

I love you so much . Truly.  Muah Muah ji heheheheh
      Your bubu
